CoffeeScript Koans is an interactive learning environment that uses failing tests to introduce students to aspects of CoffeeScript in a logical sequence.

The inspiration for this project comes from the Edgecase Ruby Koans and the book 'Javascript: The Good Parts'.

Open the file index.html in *Mozilla Firefox or Safari* and make the tests pass. Please note that it won't work in *Chrome*.

The koans use the [Qunit](http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit) test syntax and test runner.
