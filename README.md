CoffeeScript Koans is an interactive learning environment that uses failing tests to introduce students to aspects of CoffeeScript in a logical sequence. 

The inspiration for this project comes from the Edgecase Ruby Koans and the book 'Javascript: The Good Parts'.

Open the file index.html in your favourite browser and make the tests pass.

The koans use the [Qunit](http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit) test syntax and test runner.
